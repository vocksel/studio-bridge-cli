# Studio Bridge CLI

Synchronize Lua code from your computer to Roblox Studio.

```shell
# This is a CLI and should be installed globally.
$ npm install -g studio-bridge
# Once installed, you'll have `studio-bridge` accessible on the command-line.
# Pass in the `help` flag for possible arguments and flags.
$ studio-bridge --help
```

This is the CLI for Studio Bridge, a two-part project made up of a Roblox plugin and an HTTP server (managed by the CLI). See the [main repository](https://github.com/vocksel/studio-bridge) for full documentation.
