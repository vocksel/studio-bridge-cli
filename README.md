# Studio Bridge CLI

Synchronize Lua code from your computer to Roblox Studio.

This is the CLI for Studio Bridge, a two-part project made up of a Roblox plugin and an HTTP server (managed by the CLI). See the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/vocksel/studio-bridge) for full documentation on getting setup.
